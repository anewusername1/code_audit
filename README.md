I created these tools because I was tired of going through and using ack/sed/perl/whatever to replace RSpec code I didn't like.  
## bin/audit_rspec
This bash script will help you fix several things:  
  1. It will prompt to replace 'should ==' with 'should eq($1)'


I'm in the process of adding more. Check out the TODO to see some of my ideas  

## bin/audit_ruby
This script is just a place-holder for a few ideas I have
