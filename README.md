I created these tools because I was tired of going through and using ack/sed/perl/whatever to replace RSpec code I didn't like.  
## bin/bad_rspec
This bash script will help you fix several things:
  1. It will prompt to replace 'should ==' with 'should eq($1)'


I'm in the process of adding more. If you look at the script you'll see some of my ideas.  

## bin/bad_ruby
This bash script is just a place-holder for a few ideas I have
